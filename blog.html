"Veil Of Elysium"

Hear my promise of blistering light
Sowing a rose of obsidian
My dear I promise
Death comes to all
In a heartbeat only silence
Let's play with the fire that runs in our veins
Trust in the might of a miracle
Now winter has come and I'll stand in the snow
I don't feel the cold
And it's all that I will ever need to believe

One day I know we will meet again
In the shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child in Elysium
Will I know you then?
(Will I know you then?)

Now bring down your fortress and swallow your pride
Don't break in your moments of ignorance
Existence will capture a spark of life
Just a fragment, but it's all that I will ever need to revive

One day I know we will meet again
In the shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child in Elysium
Will I find you there in that darkness
Of the shadow that comes over all?
Dear friend will I know you then?
Will I know you then at all?

One day we'll meet
(One day we will meet in the shade of a life)
In the shade of a life to die for
(Watching the world)
Watching the world through the eyes of a child
Will I know you then?

One day I know we will meet again
In the shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child in Elysium
Will I know you then?
Will I know you then?</li>

"Fallen Star"
You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Sometimes the weight of the world’s
Coming over me
A feeling I can’t forget
Sometimes I find myself caught in a storm
And my future’s a nightmare away
When I’m dreaming

Sometimes I fear
I am losing your sympathies
A liar demands respect
Sometimes I fell I am losing control
And feed on the absence of love

Walking this world like animals
And into the light we’re fading

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Sometimes I’m lost in the silence of empathy
A moment I can’t reflect
Sometimes I feel like I’m loosing control
And feed on the essence of hate

Walking this world like animals
And into the dark we’re wading

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Somewhere in time
A story seldom told
Somewhere in history
Our destiny behold…

In the dead of the night I’m just a corpse
Awoken the enemy sleeping inside
In the eye of the storm we’re just the same

'cause you are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven
My song for the lost
My song for the children unforgiven

"Insomnia"
When the darkness brings the cold
To draw me under
I am caught between
The chapters of a dream
Something is reaching out and
My entire world is crumbling
And it whispers that I am
The chosen one…
Can you hear me…?

When the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall

I’m asleep but wide awake
A nightmare on repeat
In the haze I sense
The purpose of my soul
We are all born to leave a
Scar deep in the hearts of many
But can I really trust that I’m
The chosen one
Can you hear me…?

When the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall
When the night begins to fall
I hear a thousand voices call
Chasing my insanity
Like a fly on the wall

My wide eyed confidence
Still echoes in mind
A bright white prophecy
Protector of the light

When the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall
When the night begins to fall
I hear a thousand voices call
Chasing my insanity
Like a fly on the wall

"Citizen Zero"
I wait to surface
Above these bellowed growls
To sweep the shallows of utopia
I am the anchor
And the rope around your feet
In a river deep I hold you down

I’ve come to stage your abdication
I’m the creation of your sins
Embrace me

When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep

In the center
Of your greed infected wounds
I am a thorn of endless sorrow
Just one of thousands
In your self selected crown
A king to wallow in the mire
And roll in defeat…

I will protect the incubation
I am your bottomless decease
Embrace me

When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep

Pater noster
Invidia
Ira gula
Superbia acedia
Luxuria
Avaritia
Pater parce meis peccatis

All I see
Is mine to take
To have and to hold…
To suffocate
All I want
Is mine to keep
And I want it all
So father forgive me…

When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep

"Under Grey Skies"
In the ruins of madness
A ghost of a chance
There is new hope reborn in every tragedy
And the world I see bares
A mystery waiting to be revealed

And don’t you know that
Every cloud has a silver lining

You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you

In the age of confusion
Tears and despair
Let me sell you a dream of prosperity
In this great illusion
Our humble intentions are well concealed

'Cause don’t you know that
Every cloud has a silver lining

You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you
But I’ll die for that someone
In the blink of an eye
So tell me… please tell me
Just what kind of fool am I...

When I drown in my fears
In the darkness of sorrow
There’s a promise of grace
Under silver grey skies
And I’m drying my tears
In the blaze of the sunlight
A reviere sealed with a kiss

You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you
But I’ll die for that someone
In the blink of an eye
So tell me… please tell me
Just what kind of fool am I...

You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you
But I’ll die for that someone
In the blink of an eye
So tell me… please tell me
Just what kind of fool am I…
What kind of fool am I….?

"My Therapy"
When the bliss of salvation has come
I don’t mind silence and my fear is gone
It’s the chemical way to serenity
It’s faith versus science

Who fears the ticking of the clock
When centuries are passing in seconds
Black is the color of my past
A product of society’s abuse

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy

I need your voice to fill the void
A lullaby to sooth my rejection
Pure disinfection of the heart
Before this silence tears my soul apart

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy

I walk alone
On the path of self-extinction
With all these chains to pull me down
Come at night
Luminate my inner chambers
And leave the light on when you go
Please don’t go…

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy

"End Of Innocence"
Tell me do you remember
The games and the laughter
Far from the choices we’d have to make
A kiss on the lips
Turned the toad to a prince
And the end was a lifetime away

I pour myself onto this page
I am writing a swan song for ages
I will leave it behind
And just maybe you will
Remember me…

It’s the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence

Now it’s me and my knife
And the will is my temple
Numb from the choices I have to make
Slowly we all took a bite of the apple
And laughter’s a lifetime away
Remember me…

I pour myself onto this page
I am writing a swan song for ages
I will leave it behind
And just maybe you will
Remember me…

It’s the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence

Of innocence…
Where do we go from here…?

It’s the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence
